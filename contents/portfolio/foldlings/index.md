 My current project is an iPad app for designing popup cards â€“ with the goal of making the process easier and more fun.  Foldlings allows users to define a sketch of a pop-up in 2D and preview a simulation of their design in 3D, assisting the user in the exploratory process of creating pop-ups.  Designs are fabricated by hand or using a laser cutter.  Designed and developed with Marissa Allen as our Masters thesis in Computer Science, advised by [Emily Whiting](http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~emily/).  Initial prototype created with Marissa Allen and Tim Tregubov.
