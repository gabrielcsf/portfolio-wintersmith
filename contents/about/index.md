# Hello, World
I'm Nook (like the [e-reader](http://nook.com)).

I strive to make things that are functional and beautiful, exploring the intersections of technology, product, and design.  I'm fascinated by games and other systems that create delight.

Most recently, I worked at [Viacom Lab](http://www.viacomlab.com/), in a user-centered team that created products & experiences to explore the future of media.  

Before that, I was at [Dartmouth College](http://www.dartmouth.edu/), where I earned an M.S. in Computer Science with a Concentration in Digital Arts, and helped establish the [DALI Lab](http://dali.dartmouth.edu) â€” a technology innovation lab at Dartmouth.

In my free time, I play the violin and bask in my alarmingly extensive knowledge of the Harry Potter universe.  I'm annoyed by Android fragmentation and the death of the subjunctive.
